# SARBA-Net
This repository provides the **main code section** of our paper:  
**"SARBA-Net: A Boundary Awareness Network for Impervious Surface Extraction of SAR Images"**

---

## Introduction

Our research is dedicated to exploring **impervious surface (IS) extraction solely from SAR imagery**, aiming to achieve **clear-boundary IS segmentation** even under cloudy or rainy conditions when optical data are unavailable.  

The core idea of **SARBA-Net** is to **leverage boundary perception** to guide deep learning models in recognizing impervious surfaces.

## Current Release

⚠️ **Note:** This repository currently contains only a **partial implementation** of the full framework.  
Specifically, it includes two boundary-related loss functions described in the paper:

- **Boundary Contrast Loss (BCL)**  
- **Boundary Consistency Auxiliary Loss (BCAL)**  

Further modules and a complete training pipeline will be released in future updates.
